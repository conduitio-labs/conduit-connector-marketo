		Summary:     "A Adobe Marketo source connector, which syncs Leads from a given Marketo instance.",
		Description: "Marketo source connector connects to Marketo instance through the REST API with provided configuration, using `clientID` and `clientSecret`. Once connector is started `Configure` method is called to parse configurations and validate them. After that `Open` method is called to establish connection to Marketo instance with provided position. Once connection is established `Read` method is called which calls current iterator's `Next` method to fetch next record. `Teardown` is called when connector is stopped.",
